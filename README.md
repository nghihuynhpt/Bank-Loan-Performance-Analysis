# Bank Loan Performance Analysis

This was a personal project focused on tracking loan application patterns and evaluating financial health indicators. It aimed to deliver clear insights into disbursement trends, credit quality, and borrower behavior to support data-informed decision-making.

* Data was taken from the [bank loan dataset](https://ntlink.co/financial-loan-dataset).
* You can see the interactive dashboard [here](https://ntlink.co/bank-loan-report).
* **Tools used:** [SQL](https://github.com/nghihuynhpt/Nghi-s_portfolio/blob/main/SQL_scripts/Bank%20Loan%20Analysis) and [Power BI](https://github.com/nghihuynhpt/Nghi-s_portfolio/blob/main/PBIX/Pizza%20Sales%20Project.pbix).
